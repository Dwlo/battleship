Battleship
==========


# What it is about?

This game targets all developers, no  matter the language they use.<br/>
The idea behind is to make each developer write small programs and challenge others developers.<br/>
Thereby, you will have to code your own REST CLIENT and  make interactions with the Battleship server to face other developers.
